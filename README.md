# Classical_NLP

In this project a few steps of classical Natural Language Processing is applied, where the resources included in the NLTK corpus are parsed and analyzed to do three things: 
1. Distribution of alphabets and words are checked.
2. Using an Hidden Markov model, assignment of Part-of-Speech tags to words in sentences is done.
3. Using supervised learning, the Part-of-Speech tagging problem is repeated.
